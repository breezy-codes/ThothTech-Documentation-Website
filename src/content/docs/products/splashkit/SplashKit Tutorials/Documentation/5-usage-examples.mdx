## Full Walkthrough for Creating, Submitting, and Reviewing Usage Examples

This guide explains how to create, submit, and review usage examples for the Splashkit website.

### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site shows how the `write_line`
function works, with a brief explanation, program code, and a screenshot of the output.

### Steps to Create a Usage Example

A complete usage example includes:

1. C++ code version
2. C# (top-level statements) version
3. Python version
4. One-sentence explanation
5. Screenshot of the output

### Step 1: Choosing a Function

The planner board has numerous usage example suggestions for various functions, however you are
welcomed and encouraged to come up with your own creative ideas for these. Scroll through the
[Developer Documentation](https://splashkit.io/api/) to find various functions you could use
for the usage example, when coming up with an idea, make sure to also check to see if anyone
else has already done it.

Some current usage examples on the Splashkit Site:

- `is_integer`: Check if a value is an integer.
- `write_line`: Show how to use `write_line` in an ASCII art program.
- `dec_to_hex`: Convert decimal to hexadecimal.
- `fill_triangle_on_bitmap`: Create a smiley face with a triangle hat.

### Step 2 - creating the program

Create the program with as few lines of code as possible. You'll need to write the program in C++, C#
(using top-level statements), and Python, all using Splashkit. Start with the language you're most
comfortable with, then convert it to the others.

#### Example

If C++ is your strength, begin by creating a small program like this `dec_to_hex` example:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    write_line("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

    // Prompt the user for a decimal input
    write_line("Please enter a decimal number:");

    // Read the input as a string
    string dec_input = read_line();

    // Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
    unsigned int dec_value = convert_to_integer(dec_input);

    // Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal format
    string hex_value = dec_to_hex(dec_value);

    // Display the result in hexadecimal format
    write_line("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);

    return 0;
}
```

This example includes meaningful comments that clearly explain each part of the program, which helps
readers understand both the structure and function. When converting to C#, notice that the structure
and comments are kept consistent, with syntax changes specific to the language:

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

WriteLine("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

// Prompt the user for a decimal input
WriteLine("Please enter a decimal number:");

// Read the input as a string
string dec_input = ReadLine();

// Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
uint dec_value = ConvertToInteger(dec_input);

// Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal
string hex_value = DecToHex(dec_value);

// Display the result
WriteLine("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);
```

### Step 3: Explanation and Screenshot

Provide a simple explanation and a screenshot of the program's output.

**Title:** Decimal to Hex Converter  
**Explanation:** This program converts a decimal value to hexadecimal using the `dec_to_hex` function.

Take a screenshot of the output window and save it.

### Step 4 - Adding these files to Splashkit Starlight.io

Add your files to the `usage-examples-code` folder under the appropriate function category (e.g., `terminal/write_line/`).
Include the three code files and a `.txt` file with the title and explanation. The location in the
Statlight.io repo is:

<FileTree>

  - assets
    - usage-examples-code
      - animations/
      - audio/
      - camera/

          - write_line-1-hello-world.txt
      - timers/
      - utilities/
      - windows/

</FileTree>

For the screenshot, place it in the `public/usage-examples-images-gifs` folder under the relevant function.

### Submitting a Pull Request

To submit your usage example, follow the steps outlined in the [pull request guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-tutorials/onboarding/03-pull-request),
but make sure the destination branch is **usage-example-contributions**. Then use this template:

```shell
# Overview
Describe the example and what it demonstrates.

Splashkit Function: `function_name`

# Files Included
- [ ] Title and explanation (.txt)
- [ ] C++ code
- [ ] C# code (top-level statements)
- [ ] Python code
- [ ] Screenshot

# Usage Example Checks
- [ ] Simple, clear demonstration of the function
- [ ] Code uses Splashkit functions
- [ ] Tested in Chrome and Firefox
```

Once submitted, move the associated planner card to peer review and link the pull request. Follow the [Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/splashkit-tutorials/onboarding/06-planner-board) for more details on the process.

### Peer Reviewing a Usage Example

When reviewing an example, follow these steps:

1. Test each code file on your machine.
2. Check the structure and functionality of the code in each language.
3. Review the preview on the website.

```shell
# Peer Review

I've reviewed the ...

# Checks
- [ ] All required files (txt, C++, C#, Python, screenshot) are present.
- [ ] Code correctly uses Splashkit functions.
- [ ] Code clearly demonstrates the function.
- [ ] All versions maintain the same structure and comments.

# Tests done
- [ ] C++ code ran correctly.
- [ ] C# code ran correctly.
- [ ] Python code ran correctly.
```

Ensure while doing peer reviews that you also follow the [Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/splashkit-tutorials/onboarding/06-planner-board) for moving tasks through the process.
