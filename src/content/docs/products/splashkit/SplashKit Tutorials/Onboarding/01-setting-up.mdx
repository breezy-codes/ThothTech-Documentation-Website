## Get your Environment Set Up

### Install necessary tools

First things first, you'll need to install the necessary tools to get started working within Splashkit.io.
Head to the [Splashkit.io](https://splashkit.io/) website and follow the instructions for your specific
operating system to install splashkit. Then head to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
and install Docker for your specific operating system. Finally, in your code editor of choice, ensure
you have added the [Astro Extension](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) to your editor.

### Fork the Splashkit.io Repo

To get started working within the Starlight.io you need to first head over to GitHub and make your
own fork of the [Splashkit Repo](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight).
