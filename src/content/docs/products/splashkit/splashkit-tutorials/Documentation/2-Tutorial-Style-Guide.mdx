import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## General

Create tutorial in an `.mdx` file.

Make sure your tutorials follow the **markdownlint** extension's formatting.

Correct any yellow squiggly lines.

## Headings

Make sure to use the following **title** format:

```mdx
---
title: Tutorial Heading
---
```

Then use `## Heading` for the highest heading level.

Always keep a blank line between headings and other text.

### Subheadings

For subheadings that you want to see in the RHS sidebar/panel on splashkit.io, use `### Subheading`.
Subheadings lower than this will not be shown.

Do not use bolded lines for headings/subheadings.

## Links

Do not use any "raw" links. Links must always use the following format:

```mdx
[Text to show for link](URL link)
```

Make sure to link your headings within the same file if these are mentioned, using the following
format:

```mdx
[Heading text](#link-to-heading)
```

## Images

Always keep a blank line between images and other text.

Use the following format for all images:

```mdx
![Alt text](link to image)
```

For the **Alt text** part above: Briefly explain what the image is showing. This is important for
accessibility.

For the **link to image** part above: If you are linking an image resource that you have downloaded,
this will need to be put into an **images** folder in the same place as the tutorial.  
For example, with the **skbox.png** image in the images folder here, you would use:

```mdx
![Image of SplashKit box logo](./images/skbox.png)
```

Which would produce:

![Image of SplashKit box logo](./images/skbox.png)

## Lists

Always keep a blank line between lists and other text.

## Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks for any code snippets or terminal commands, to make it easier for the reader
to copy.

Always include a language with the fenced code blocks.

### C# Code

For example, if using C#, you would use the following format:

````md
```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
ClearScreen();
RefreshScreen();
Delay(5000);

CloseAllWindows();
```
````

Which would produce:

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
ClearScreen();
RefreshScreen();
Delay(5000);

CloseAllWindows();
```

### C++ Code

For C++, you would use the following format:

````md
```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
    clear_screen();
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);

    close_all_windows();

    return 0;
}
```
````

Which would produce:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
    clear_screen();
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);

    close_all_windows();

    return 0;
}
```

For any blocks that are not code, you can use `plaintext` for the language. For terminal commands,
use `shell` for the language.

If your guide is only using 1 language (and not using at least both C# and C++), make sure to
include the language used in the title.

### Multiple Code Languages

To show the same code in different languages, you will need to use
[Tabs](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#tabs).

Make sure to add the following line to your file underneath the title:

```mdx
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

;
```

And then using the examples from above, you would have:

````md
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
ClearScreen();
RefreshScreen();
Delay(5000);

CloseAllWindows();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
    clear_screen();
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);

    close_all_windows();

    return 0;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

Which would produce the following:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
ClearScreen();
RefreshScreen();
Delay(5000);

CloseAllWindows();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("SplashKit!", 800, 600);
    clear_screen();
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);

    close_all_windows();

    return 0;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Callouts (Asides)

Use callouts (also known as [Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#asides)) to
highlight tips or important notes.
