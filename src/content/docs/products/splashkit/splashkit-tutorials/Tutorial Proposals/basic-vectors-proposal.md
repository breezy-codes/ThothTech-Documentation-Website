title: Basic Vectors Tutorial Proposal
---

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of vector mathematics and some applications (such as in
game development). The intended audience will be for beginners to intermediate learners, and will
guide them through understanding and implementing vector operations, including angle and magnitude
calculations, vector addition and subtraction, and the dot product. It will also cover other
techniques like vector normals and basic reflection, all within the context of creating dynamic game
mechanics. By the end, it will lead to a greater understanding of using vectors to enhance program
functionality and interactivity.

## Tutorial Details

### Tutorial Structure

This tutorial will follow an "as-you-go" approach, introducing concepts and code snippets
progressively. Each section will focus on a specific vector operation, providing both theoretical
background and practical implementation. Visual aids and code examples will be used throughout to
help illustrate the concepts. It will also contain the code for the learner to run themselves and
adjust the values as they please to see the effects on the program.

### Level of Difficulty

This tutorial is geared towards beginners and intermediate learners with basic programming
knowledge. It's ideal for those looking to expand their understanding of game mechanics through
vector mathematics.

### Functions Covered

The tutorial will cover the following main SplashKit functions:

1. [double vector_angle(const vector_2d v)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-angle)
2. [double vector_magnitude(const vector_2d &v)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-magnitude)
3. [vector_2d vector_add(const vector_2d &v1, const vector_2d &v2)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-add)
4. [vector_2d vector_subtract(const vector_2d &v1, const vector_2d &v2)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-subtract)
5. [vector_2d vector_normal(const vector_2d &v)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-normal)
6. [double dot_product(const vector_2d &v1, const vector_2d &v2)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#dot-product)
7. [vector_2d vector_multiply(const vector_2d &v1, double s)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-multiply)
8. [vector_2d vector_point_to_point(const point_2d &start, const point_2d &end_pt)](https://splashkit.io/api/physics/#vector-point-to-point)

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to vectors and their applications in game
development. By understanding and utilising vector operations, readers can significantly enhance the
realism and responsiveness of their games. Whether creating simple games or increasing the
interactivity of their existing games, the skills gained from this tutorial will add complexity to
their programs.
