## Full Walkthrough for Creating, Submitting, and Reviewing Usage Examples

This guide explains how to create, submit, and review usage examples for the Splashkit website.

### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site shows how the `write_line`
function works, with a brief explanation, program code, and a screenshot of the output.

### Steps to Create a Usage Example

A complete usage example includes:

1. C++ code version
2. C# (top-level statements) version
3. C# (Object-Oriented Programming) version
4. Python version
5. One-sentence explanation
6. Screenshot of the output

### Step 1: Choosing a Function

The planner board has numerous usage example suggestions for various functions, however you are
welcomed and encouraged to come up with your own creative ideas for these. Scroll through the
[Developer Documentation](https://splashkit.io/api/) to find various functions you could use
for the usage example, when coming up with an idea, make sure to also check to see if anyone
else has already done it.

Some current usage examples on the Splashkit Site:

- `is_integer`: Check if a value is an integer.
- `write_line`: Show how to use `write_line` in an ASCII art program.
- `dec_to_hex`: Convert decimal to hexadecimal.
- `fill_triangle_on_bitmap`: Create a smiley face with a triangle hat.

### Step 2 - creating the program

Create the program with as few lines of code as possible. You'll need to write the program in C++, C#
(using top-level statements and OOP version), and Python, all using Splashkit. Start with the language
you're most comfortable with, then convert it to the others.

Note for C# to-level: Use `using static SplashkitSDK.SplashKit;`. For the OOP version: use `using SplashKitSDK;`.

#### Example

If C++ is your strength, begin by creating a small program like this `dec_to_hex` example:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    write_line("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

    // Prompt the user for a decimal input
    write_line("Please enter a decimal number:");

    // Read the input as a string
    string dec_input = read_line();

    // Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
    unsigned int dec_value = convert_to_integer(dec_input);

    // Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal format
    string hex_value = dec_to_hex(dec_value);

    // Display the result in hexadecimal format
    write_line("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);

    return 0;
}
```

This example includes meaningful comments that clearly explain each part of the program, which helps
readers understand both the structure and function. When converting to C#, notice that the structure
and comments are kept consistent, with syntax changes specific to the language:

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

WriteLine("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

// Prompt the user for a decimal input
WriteLine("Please enter a decimal number:");

// Read the input as a string
string dec_input = ReadLine();

// Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
uint dec_value = ConvertToInteger(dec_input);

// Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal
string hex_value = DecToHex(dec_value);

// Display the result
WriteLine("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);
```

### Step 3: Explanation and Screenshot

Provide a simple explanation and a screenshot of the program's output.

**Title:** Decimal to Hex Converter  
**Explanation:** This program converts a decimal value to hexadecimal using the `dec_to_hex` function.

Take a screenshot of the output window and save it.

### Step 4 - Adding these files to Splashkit Starlight.io

Now that you're done, you should have the following files:

- txt file
- C++ file
- python file
- C# (top-level statements) file
- C# (OOP) file
- Screenshot of the output

Now you'll need to rename these before adding them to the Splashkit Starlight.io repo.

#### Example

Say you've created a `dec_to_hex` program. Rename the files as follows:

- `dec_to_hex-1-converter.txt`
- `dec_to_hex-1-converter.cpp`
- `dec_to_hex-1-converter.py`
- `dec_to_hex-1-converter_top.cs`
- `dec_to_hex-1-converter_oop.cs`
- `dec_to_hex-1-converter.png`

Now you can add these files to the Splashkit Starlight.io repo. If when you add them you find
there is already some files of a usage example using this same function, then you should increment
the number in the file name by 1.

### Step 5 - Adding these files to Splashkit Starlight.io

Now that your files are named, add your files to the `usage-examples-code` folder under the
appropriate function category (e.g., `terminal/write_line/`). Include the four code files and the
`.txt` file with the title and explanation. The location in the Statlight.io repo is:

          - write_line-1-hello-world.txt
      - timers/
      - utilities/
      - windows/

</FileTree>

For the screenshot, place it in the `public/usage-examples-images-gifs` folder under the relevant function.
