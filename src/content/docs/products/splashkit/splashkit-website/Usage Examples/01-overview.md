## Overview

### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site found [here](https://splashkit.io/usage-examples/terminal/#hello-world-string)
shows how the `write_line` function works, with a brief explanation, program code, and a
screenshot of the output.

The following pages cover all the steps to create, submit, and review usage examples for the
Splashkit website.
