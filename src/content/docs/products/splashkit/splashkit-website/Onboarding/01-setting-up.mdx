## Get Your Environment Set Up

### Install Necessary Tools

First things first, you'll need to install the necessary tools to get started working within SplashKit.io.
Head to the [SplashKit.io](https://splashkit.io/) website and follow the instructions for your specific
operating system to install SplashKit. Then, head to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
and install Docker for your specific operating system. Finally, in your code editor of choice, ensure
you have added the [Astro Extension](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) to your editor.

### Fork the SplashKit.io Repo

To get started working within the Starlight repo, you need to first head over to GitHub and make your
own fork of the [SplashKit Repo](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight).
